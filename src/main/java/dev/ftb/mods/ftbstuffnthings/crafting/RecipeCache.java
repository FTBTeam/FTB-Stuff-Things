     * which apply to those contents. Typically, these are item and fluid inventories, but other conditions may also
     * be considered, e.g. a machine's current "temperature" based on adjacent blocks (think: Tempered Jars).

     *                     along all known recipes of this type; this method is only called if there is no cache hit

     *                          finding the recipe; this hashcode is used as the key to quickly finding the recipe in
